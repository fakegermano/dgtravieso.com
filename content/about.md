Hello, I'm a computer engineer, graduated from [Unicamp](https://ic.unicamp.br). My main areas of interest are: Software Engineering, Systems Programming and High Performance Computing. I have  experience with freelance web development with [django](https://djangoproject.com). Currently I am a software developer at [kryptus](https://kryptus.com) working in a Research & Development multi-disciplinary team as the tech lead and backend developer. Most of my day-to-day work is done in [python](https://python.org) with microservice frameworks such as [fastapi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com). I also do work as the IT specialist for the communications agency [ctv.lab](https://ctvlab.co).

This below is what my face looks like!
